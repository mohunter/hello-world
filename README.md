# hello-world
just to get started

I am currently trying to get my feet wet with github.

Ideally I will be creating code and methods for making GLAS / ICESat data more accessible and to eventual assess whether degradation signals are apparent in GLAS satellite lidar.

To do this, I plan to:
(1) Determine which files on NSIDC are necessary to pull waveforms and the associated laser and geospatial information.
(2) Determine if these waveforms need to be corrected based on the laser power, or if this step is specific to Glacier Altimetry.
(3) Develop a processing stream for the raw GLAS downloads.
(4) Create a GIS in QGIS that overlays GLAS waveform locations with Asner and Morton logging and fire maps
(5) Maybe play with neural networks? Decision trees? to attempt to determine waveform patterns that may be indicative of forest degradation.
